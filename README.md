# The Game That You Will Never Win
## What's the point?
This is just a practice project.I create this project for my practice in programming (and just for fun,why not).You can't
use this game for production as a complete project. 
## Rules of the game
* There are 2 players, Player and Bot
* User playes for Player and my program plays for Bot
* Each player in order tells a number between 1-10 and that number adds to the one total score
* Which player first reaches the 100 points, he will win the game
* The Game always start the Bot and always says 1 in the first attempt
